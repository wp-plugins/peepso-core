Yes! PeepSo was designed from the beginning to be used with your existing theme and does not require a theme designed to work with PeepSo. We have tested PeepSo with several themes and Frameworks already but your theme may require some customization. You can do this by copying template files into a `peepso/` directory within your theme folder and modifying them.
